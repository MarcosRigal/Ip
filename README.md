# Instructions:
The practices are organized as follows:
  
The P# folders represent each of the practices with their corresponding number, also in each practice you will find a PDF document with the statements of the exercises.  
  
Within these folders are a series of subfolders denoted as E# that represent each of the exercises of the practices.  
  
**Exercises:** made up of 3 files: First, a .eje file where the main and functions are stored, a .cpp file that also stores the main and the function's header and an executable file with the compiled program.  
  
The executables have been compiled in Windows 10, so if you want to run them just download them and double click on them. It is also possible to compile the executables for Linux but it could be necesary to refactor part of the code. It should be noted that the .eje files are "encrypted" with the ID of the student who created them because they were created with DevUCO, a tool from the University of CÃ³rdoba. That is why it is very possible that you cannot modify or compile them. So you would have to make use of the .cpp files and compile them to get an executable with the modifications.
